**Kauai** is the northwestern most of :doc:`Hawaii </index>`'s major islands.
Nicknamed the Garden Island, it is covered with lush greenery and
tropical plants, watered regularly by abundant rainfall. As the oldest
of the islands, it has been changed the most by the forces of erosion,
and this has resulted in natural wonders such as Waimea Canyon and the
Na Pali Coast. As a consequence of its age, Kauai also has more miles of
sandy coastline than the other Hawaiian islands.

Tourist Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In many ways, Kauai is different from the rest of the islands. It's almost as if you've stepped into a separate kingdom, and for many years Kauai was just that in relation to Hawaii. Kamehameha I was able to conquer all the islands by force, except Kauai. Two separate campaigns to take the island ended in failure. In the end, it took diplomacy, a royal kidnapping, and an arranged marriage to bring Kauai into the kingdom of Hawaii.

.. warning:: This island can be quite hot in the summer!
