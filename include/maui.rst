   It is well known for its 52 mile scenic drive which connects it to
   Kahului. The drive can take up to four hours, complete with one lane
   bridges and hairpin turns. Surrounding the city are lush rainforests,
   while rolling pastures are prevalent even on Main Street. Hana is
   home to the historic St. Sophia’s Church as well as beautiful black
   sand beaches running along the shoreline.
-  Haiku -- an iconic example of Maui’s cultural melting pot. Nestled
   ten miles upcountry past Paia, the township is known for its
   agricultural aspects and plantations. It consists of little more than
   a post office, several shops, and quiet suburbs.
-  Kahului -- was built in the 1950s by a plantation company, and
   hailed as a “dream city”. It is the commercial hub and transportation
   center of Maui with the two largest malls, main airport and a
   deep-water port.
-  Kaanapali -- a tourist heavy region on the west coast. Close to
   Lahaina, this city sports many hotels and festivals to draw in
   visitors.
