**Hawaii** (`Hawaiian`_: *Hawai ªi*, sometimes pronounced
*ha-VAI-ee* by locals) is the 50th state of the `United States of
America`_. Situated nearly at the center of the north Pacific Ocean,
Hawaii marks the northeast corner of `Polynesia`_. While it was once a
major hub for the whaling, sugar and pineapple industries, it is now
economically dependent on tourism and the U.S. military. The natural
beauty of the islands continues to be one of Hawaii's greatest assets.
`Honolulu`_ is the state's capital, largest city, and cultural hub.
`Hawaiian <Hawaiian>`__ and English are the official languages of
Hawaii.
