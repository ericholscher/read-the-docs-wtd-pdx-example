### Crime Update

Theft is a big problem in cities as well as beaches and parks. If you
are camping on a beach, keep bags locked in a car (but don't assume that
they are safe in the trunk, especially if you are driving a rental) and
keep valuables in a hidden money belt. Although [Hawaii] is generally
considered relatively safe, it does have some violent crime, especially
in Honolulu. Consequently, women should not walk alone in unlit areas.
Although Honolulu has one of the lowest violent crime rates of metro
areas in the U.S., use your common sense. Stay smart and act as if you
were in your own home city: lock doors, lock cars, and don't leave
valuables lying around.

In general, do not bring anything to the beach that you will not use. If
you absolutely must, keep valuables to a minimum (such as money), and
bring a friend. If you are using a rental car and do not have valuables
in it, leaving the window open can ward off window damage from
break-ins. Purchasing local bumper stickers and placing them on your car
can also ward off would-be thieves, who may mistake your car for being a
local's.
